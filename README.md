## Bio
I am a Security Engineer who shifts things left.
I value pragmatism, creativity, versatility and kindness.

### Work
- the professional version: [My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lichao-li-50753739/)
- the back story: I started my first job in IT project management. On my first day of work I was given a Ubuntu workstation. And the only Linux Sysadmin in the company was leaving. I took over his job temporarily, but stayed in the profession since I enjoy fixing problems with the Terminal +  Google combo.

### Life
- I was born in the outskirt of ([Changchun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changchun)), where I frolicked in the corn fields as a child. I moved to the concrete jungle part of the city when school started.
- I moved to my 2nd hometown ([Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore)) in 2002, back when GST was 3% and there were 2 MRT lines. Other than the community libraries (with free AC), I enjoyed spending time in the West Coast Park and the East Coast Park, and wondered about the other side of the ocean. 
- I moved to my 3rd hometown ([the SF Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area)) in 2015. Settled down with my family here. My favorite food are Pho and Bahn Mi, which offer a taste of Southeast Asia away from Souteast Asia. And I enjoy exploring 'exotic' grocery stores.

### Hobbies
- crimping cables, tuning pianos, picking locks (of my own)
- hiking
- reading books about history, philosophy, the constructs of governments etc
- 15-ball pool

### Favorite Books
- 金庸系列, 盗墓笔记, Sherlock Holmes series, The Adventures of Tintin
