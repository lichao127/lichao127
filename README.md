## Bio
I am a Security Engineer who shifts things left.
I value pragmatism, creativity, versatility and kindness.

### Work
- the professional version: [My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lichao-li-50753739/)
- the back story: I started my first job in IT project management. On my first day of work I was given a Ubuntu workstation by chance. And the only Linux Sysadmin in the company was leaving. I took over his job temporarily, but stayed in the profession since I enjoy typing in the Terminal.

### Life
- I was born on the outskirts of Changchun, China, where I frolicked in cornfields as a child. I moved to the concrete jungle part of the city when school started.
- I moved to my second hometown, Singapore, in 2002, back when GST was 3% and there were only two MRT lines. Aside from the community libraries (with free air conditioning), I enjoyed spending time in West Coast Park and East Coast Park, and I often wondered about the other side of the ocean.
- I moved to my third hometown, the SF Bay Area, in 2015 and settled down here with my family. I like the Vietnamese food here. Pho and bánh mì are my favorites. They offer a taste of Southeast Asia away from Southeast Asia, and I enjoy exploring "exotic" grocery stores.

### Hobbies
- crimping cables, tuning pianos, picking locks (of my own)
- hiking
- reading books about history, philosophy, the constructs of governments etc
- 15-ball pool

### Favorite Books
- 金庸系列, 盗墓笔记, Sherlock Holmes series, The Adventures of Tintin

### Favorite Websites
- GitHub, Medium, Reddit, Spotify, StackOverflow, TryHackMe
